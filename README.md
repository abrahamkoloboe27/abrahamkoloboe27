## üìà Notable Projects

Here are some of my recent projects:

### [üçé Fruits Recognition Training](https://github.com/abrahamkoloboe27/Fruits-Recognition-Training)

Development and evaluation of AI models for fruit image classification, including custom CNN, EfficientNet, ResNet, and VGG16.

### [üçå Fruits Recognition Streamlit App](https://github.com/abrahamkoloboe27/Fruits-Recognition-Streamlit-App)

Interactive application built with Streamlit for real-time fruit image classification. Users can upload an image and receive model predictions with confidence scores.

### [üìä Churn Prediction and Analysis Project](https://github.com/abrahamkoloboe27/Churn-Prediction-and-Analysis-Project)

Customer data analysis and churn risk prediction using machine learning techniques. The project includes an exploratory dashboard and features for individual and batch predictions.

### [üè† API Housing Price Prediction](https://github.com/abrahamkoloboe27/API-Housing-Price-Prediction)

API developed with FastAPI to predict house prices based on various features. The API accepts house attributes as input and returns the predicted price.
